This tutorial is only working with the Xiaomi MI Band 8. Not with the Xiaomi Mi Band 8 Active or other Smartbands. However it should be possible to use other bands. For the watches supported by https://github.com/m0tral/EasyFace it should be simple. Just ask me in the issues.

There are some apps and tools involved:
- The Mi Band 8 has a special watchface installed via the app "Mi Band 8 Watch Faces" to display jump data: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=asn.ark.miband8&hl=de&gl=US&pli=1
- The surfr app runs in wetsuit mode and automatically creates an android broadcast on every jump: https://play.google.com/store/search?q=surfr&c=apps&hl=de&gl=US
- The Automate app intercepts surfr's broadcasts, converts them to a special format, increases the jump count, the max jump height and sends all data to the gadgetbridge app and also tells gadgetbridge to vibrate the band: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.llamalab.automate&hl=de&gl=US
- Gadgetbridge is connected to the Mi Band 8 and sends the jump data to the Band and tells it to vibrate: https://freeyourgadget.codeberg.page/fdroid/repo/nodomain.freeyourgadget.gadgetbridge.nightly_nopebble_0.80.0-9ba96231c.apk
- The Band vibrates and displays the jump data
